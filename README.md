# Charicode

I often get calls from recruiters about contracts for charities, usually for a little lower than usual day rates. While many developers see no issue with dropping their rates a little for charities, it made me wonder how costly the process is for them with recruiter fees on top. So I decided to build Charicode, to provide a free, open source solution for charities to reach out to contractors.

At this early stage, I thought the easiest way to test it out would be to have it driven by a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AmgPHmuDEFcK0oAlRNmOrv6TAAIux11wm2LGsV3X8Go/edit?usp=sharing), anyone can add jobs to this freely, and it saves someone having to manage manually via emails/tweets/messages in bottles.

## Dependencies

This project utilises Node, React and Redux.

## Install

Once you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed and have cloned the repo, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## To Do

* Add some visual goodness, bootstrap should suffice for the time being.
* Add filtering to the job list (i.e. 'front end', 'london').
* Submit/remove jobs via the front end.

## Contributing

Feel to suggest and add improvements, this is still very much a work in progress.
